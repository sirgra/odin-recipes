    <h4>Picture of a fresh Caesar Salad</h4>
    <p>Caesar Salad is a classic dish known for its crisp romaine lettuce, creamy dressing, and crunchy croutons.<br>
        The salad is typically topped with grilled chicken or shrimp, making it a hearty meal option.<br>
        The dressing is made from a blend of garlic, anchovies, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and Parmesan cheese,
        creating a rich and tangy flavor that complements the fresh greens.<br>
        The addition of croutons adds a satisfying crunch, while the Parmesan cheese provides a salty, nutty finish.<br>
        This salad is perfect as a light lunch or as a side dish for dinner, and it pairs well with a variety of main courses.<br>
        Whether enjoyed at a restaurant or made at home, Caesar Salad remains a favorite for its simplicity and delicious taste.</p>

    <p>Spaghetti is a classic Italian pasta dish that is loved worldwide for its simplicity and deliciousness.<br>
        The dish typically features long, thin noodles made from durum wheat, cooked al dente and served with a variety of sauces.<br>
        A popular choice is the traditional tomato sauce, made from ripe tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs like basil and oregano.<br>
        For a richer flavor, many recipes include ground meat or vegetables sautéed in olive oil before adding the sauce.<br>
        Spaghetti can also be served with creamy sauces like Alfredo or carbonara, which include ingredients like cream, cheese, and pancetta.<br>
        This versatile dish can be customized with various toppings such as grated Parmesan cheese, fresh herbs, or chili flakes for added heat.</p>

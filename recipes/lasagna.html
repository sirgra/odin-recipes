    <h4>Picture of a fresh slice of Lasagna</h4>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with a rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and plenty of cheese.<br>
        To begin, ground beef is sautéed with onions and garlic, then simmered with tomatoes, herbs, and a touch of red wine for depth of flavor.<br>
        A smooth béchamel sauce made from butter, flour, and milk adds a silky layer between the pasta and meat.<br>
        Grated Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses are sprinkled generously throughout each layer, creating a perfect balance of textures and flavors.
    </p>

    <p>Once the layers are assembled in a baking dish—starting with sauce, then pasta, then béchamel and cheese—the lasagna is baked in the oven until bubbling and golden brown on top.<br>
        After resting for a few minutes to set, it slices easily into hearty portions. This comforting, satisfying meal pairs wonderfully with a simple green salad and a glass of red wine,<br>
        making it perfect for family dinners or casual gatherings with friends.
